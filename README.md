# Resonance-Toolbox
This repository maintains the complete list of resources to compute the resonance mechanism.

The below figure depicts two objects with oscillatory properties, such as persons. The link shows a relationship between the property of one object to another. The linkage between property would define the relationship, and depending on the relationship obtained, a type of resonance can be defined.

We aim to create a framework for the measurement and analysis used to decode the brain oscillations in naturalistic scenarios. Insofar as naturalistic stimuli are also captured, they can be compared to the concurrent brain oscillations. Entrainment and resonance are theoretically informed mechanisms describing how subjects are likely to respond to naturalistic stimuli that is oscillatory in nature. A framework of resonance/entrainment can therefore inform how the brain will respond to stimuli in naturalistic scenarios. Measures of entrainment and resonance can be assembled and applied to existing datasets and then used to inform the production of new datasets.
