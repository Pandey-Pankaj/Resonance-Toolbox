# Resonance-Toolbox

The below figure depicts two objects with oscillatory properties, such as persons. The link shows a relationship between the property of one object to another. The linkage between property would define the relationship, and depending on the relationship obtained, a type of resonance can be defined.

Resonance is an observable physical phenomenon in brain imaging studies. 

| Operational measurements  | 
| ------------- | 
| Stimulus-Response Correlation | 
| Inter-Subject Correlation |
| Entrainment|


I have compiled the techniques that can be used to compute the resonance effects.


| Metric  | 
| ------------- | 
| Canoncial Correlation Analysis | 
| Cross-Correlation |
| Phase-Locking Value |
